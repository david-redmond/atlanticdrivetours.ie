        "title": "O'Brien's Tower",
        "text": "O'Brien's Tower was built in 1835 by Cornelius O'Brien, a local MP who wanted to impress visitors — and perhaps a certain woman he was courting. Today it still marks the highest point of the cliffs and the best spot to watch the Atlantic roll in."

        "title": "The Burren & the coast",
        "text": "The Burren's limestone landscape has been called a place where the veil between worlds is thin. Old stories speak of the sí and of winter fires that never quite go out; we leave the clichés behind and keep the sense of something older than the roads."

      {
        "title": "Bunratty Castle",
        "text": "Bunratty Castle saw sieges, clan battles, and the rise and fall of the O'Brien dynasty. What you walk through today is the 15th-century version, restored so you can touch the same stone that held off raiders and welcomed chieftains."
      },
      {
        "title": "Liscannor",
        "text": "Liscannor village, just along the coast, takes its name from the old Irish for 'the hollow of the sea.' Fishermen and storytellers have lived here for centuries; your driver might point out the harbour where the currachs still go out when the weather allows."
